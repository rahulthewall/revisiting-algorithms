Barebones implementation of common algorithms in JavaScript, and the solution to a few association common problems.

The implementation for the algorithms is based on the pseudocde from the book Introduction to Algorithms. 

The following algorithms have been implemented
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort

You will also find solutions to the following common problems
- Find all pairs in an array which can add up to a given sum
